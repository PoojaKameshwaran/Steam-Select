# Steam Select: A Steam Game Recommendation System ðŸŽ®  

## Overview  
**Steam Select** is a cutting-edge recommendation system designed to help Steam users discover new video games based on their preferences. Users interact with a chatbot interface, providing details about games they liked or disliked. The system suggests similar games, dissimilar games, or profitable bundles tailored to the user's interests.  

This project leverages advanced recommendation techniques and an intuitive chatbot interface to deliver an engaging and personalized experience for gamers.
